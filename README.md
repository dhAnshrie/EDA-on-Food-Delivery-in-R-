<h1>Analyzing Food Delivery Data in R</h1>
Food delivery services have become an integral part of our daily lives, especially with the rise of online ordering platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, and Foodpanda are leading the way. 
These companies generate vast amounts of data related to orders, customers, and restaurants that can be analyzed to gain insights into various aspects of food delivery services.
Analyzing this data can offer valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, delivery performance, and emerging trends. For instance,
businesses can identify peak ordering times, understand the types of cuisine that are most popular, 
optimize delivery routes, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

<h2>Overview of the Food Delivery Dataset</h2>
Food delivery datasets are comprehensive and include a variety of information crucial for understanding the dynamics of food delivery services.
This food delivery dataset is taken from Kaggle. The dataset includes various columns related to the food delivery process.
<h3>Dataset</h3>
These datasets are highly relevant in todayâ€™s market as they help businesses:

Understand Customer Behavior: Analyzing patterns in customer orders, preferences, and feedback.
Improve Delivery Efficiency: Identifying bottlenecks and optimizing delivery routes and times.
Identify Emerging Trends: Recognizing shifts in customer preferences, peak order times, and emerging market demands.

Analyzing Food Delivery Data
We will demonstrate a comprehensive analysis of a food delivery dataset in R Programming Language.
We will start by importing the necessary libraries, then proceed with data loading, cleaning, visualization, descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and regression analysis.

Step 1: Import Libraries
First, we need to import the required libraries for our analysis.
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
library(car)

Step 2: Load the Dataset
To import the food delivery dataset into R, utilize the read.csv() function.

Step 3: Data Cleaning
Perform data cleaning to ensure the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis.

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is a crucial step in understanding the underlying characteristics and patterns within the dataset
